Always extend a class when it has only "IS A RELATIONSHIP" with the parent class
In that case , make it as static and call the function with Classname . function()

If anyone shouldnt extend that class make it as final class and if anyone doesnt want to change the method by calling/extending the class , create a private empty constructor in that class

Use private access modifier for the variable if none should extend that in child class
Use protected access modifier for the variable only if Child class can do the changes of it
